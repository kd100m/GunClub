Like Loot but for the firearm community.

What I'm attempting here draws inspiration from the Loot concept. Now, having never played, my idea may be completely different from the game mechanics of Loot.

Here's what I'm imagining.
  
  I would prefer to make an extremely inclusive play to earn game. 
  think Axie Infinity + Pokemon Cards(physical cards) + War(the card game) + Call of Duty. 
  I'm imagining the mint happens on Polygon. I'd like to minimize the cost to play yet still having gameplay data/outcomes occur on-chain. 

New Players mint/purchase their loadouts 

   they are like the Loot cards they are NFTs that were minted and now people can buy them on opensea.
   
   loadouts like loot cards have traits. 
   
           Digital Camo - the color
           556 AR Pistol - the firearm
           Standard Semi - the trigger
           Low Powered Variable Optic  - the optic
           Double Agent - the character
           Evil - the characters morality/alignment
           Box of Tissues - healing item
           Power: 82 - power score
           
           
    
   here's an example of another loadout
   
          Woodland Camo
          762 AK Pistol
          Standard Semi
          5-50x Scope
          Maverick
          Money Motivated
          Medkit
          Power: 45
