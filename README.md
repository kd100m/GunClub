Like Loot but for the firearm community.

What I'm attempting here draws inspiration from the Loot concept. Now, having never played, my idea may be completely different from the game mechanics of Loot.

Here's what I'm imagining....


  
  I would prefer to make an extremely inclusive play to earn game, think 
  
  Axie Infinity -
       
       I like the fact Axie provides an income for its players and is accessible to lower income players. I would like to model its success. 
       
       
  Pokemon Cards(physical cards) *Expirimental* -
                    
        I like the idea of a physical representation of the NFT to lure non-crypto people into the game. Not exactly sure the mechanics of it all. 
  
  
  War (the card game) - 
        
                  The game where the you have a deck of shuffled cards split between players. players flip a card and the player with the
                  highest value card wins. 
                  
                  I like the randomness element because this keeps the game fair, I'm hoping to avoid a Pay-to-Win situation. 
                  
                    introducing the games core element Shootout
                        
                      essentially each player's (power score) is multiplied by a randomly selected (score multiplier). The Player with highest value wins. 
                           
                            power score - a loadout has a power value assigned at mint
                            power multiplier - a random value given to each player at the time of the match.
                            map advantage - IN PROGRESS - an advantage for short and long range weapons
                  
                       
  
  
  
  Call of Duty -
                 
    Well it is a game about guns, I think long range weapons should fare better in larger maps, short range/shorter barrel guns are more ideal in smaller maps.
  
  
  I'm imagining the mint happens on Polygon. I'd like to minimize the cost to play yet still having gameplay data/outcomes occur on-chain. 
  

  My idea is to allow loadouts to have somewhat of an advantage 
  

New Players mint/purchase their loadouts 


   they are like the Loot cards they are NFTs that were minted and now people can buy them on opensea.
   
   loadouts like loot cards have traits. 
   
           Digital Camo - the color
           556 AR Pistol - the firearm
           Standard Semi - the trigger
           Low Powered Variable Optic  - the optic
           Double Agent - the character
           Evil - the characters morality/alignment
           Box of Tissues - healing item
           Power: 82 - power score
           
           
    
   here's an example of another loadout
   
          Woodland Camo
          762 AK Pistol
          Standard Semi
          5-50x Scope
          Maverick
          Money Motivated
          Medkit
          Power: 45
